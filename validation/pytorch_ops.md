addmm:              Matrix multiplication of a matrix with another matrix after adding a bias. Itâ€™s used for operations like linear transformations in neural networks.

linear:             Applies a linear transformation to the input data. This operation typically performs a matrix multiplication followed by an addition of a bias term.

matmul:             Matrix multiplication of two tensors. This is a more general operation than addmm, and can be used for various matrix operations.

mm:                 Matrix multiplication for 2-D tensors (batch matrix multiplication).

mul:                Element-wise multiplication of tensors.

scaled_dot_product_attention:           Computes attention scores and applies them to the value tensors, often used in self-attention mechanisms.

_scaled_dot_product_flash_attention_for_cpu:            A specific implementation of the scaled dot-product attention for CPU, optimized for performance.

layer_norm:         Applies layer normalization to the input tensor, which normalizes the input across the features.

add:                Element-wise addition of tensors.

native_layer_norm:  A native implementation of layer normalization, possibly optimized for performance.

view:               Reshapes a tensor without changing its data.

tanh:               Applies the hyperbolic tangent function element-wise.

copy_:              Copies data from one tensor to another tensor in place.

to:                 Moves a tensor to a specified device (e.g., CPU, GPU) or changes its dtype.

split:              Splits a tensor into chunks along a specified dimension.

_to_copy:           Likely an internal function for handling tensor copies.

pow:                Raises each element of the tensor to the specified power.

transpose:          Permutes the dimensions of the tensor, swapping specified dimensions.

empty:              Creates an uninitialized tensor with the specified shape.

embedding:          Looks up embeddings for a set of indices from an embedding matrix.

narrow:             Slices a tensor along a specified dimension, producing a narrowed view of the original tensor.

permute:            Reorders the dimensions of the tensor.

expand:             Expands the dimensions of a tensor to a specified shape, allowing it to be broadcasted with other tensors.

as_strided:         Creates a view of a tensor with a different stride pattern.

arange:             Creates a tensor with a sequence of numbers.

index_select:       Selects elements from a tensor along a specified dimension using indices.

slice:              Extracts a slice from a tensor.

empty_strided:      Similar to empty, but allows specifying strides for the tensor.

select:             Selects elements from a tensor along a specified dimension.

unsqueeze:          Adds a dimension of size one at a specified position.

resolve_conj:       Likely deals with complex tensor operations related to conjugation.

dropout:            Applies dropout to the tensor, which randomly zeroes some of the elements during training to prevent overfitting.

_unsafe_view:       An internal operation for viewing tensors without checking safety constraints.

resize_:            Resizes a tensor in place.

reshape:            Reshapes a tensor to a specified shape.

t:                  Transposes the tensor, flipping its dimensions.

result_type:        Returns the data type of the result of a computation.
